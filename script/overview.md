## Setting

This world is born of a single flower. It's a delicate little cornflower, only an annual. Beyond its own understanding, it wills into existence a little town, and in this town is a little girl.

The flower and the girl become friends, making conversation between them. At times, it shouldn't be clear whether this flower is actually talking or the girl is just playing children's games.
The girl gets a pot for the flower so they can take walks together.
Since cornflowers have vaguely medicinal properties, the flower's petals can serve to protect and heal the girl. Eventually, over the course of the game, the flower will look sad and have only a couple petals left.
The flower can’t be hurt by anything; it created this world. But the girl is vulnerable.

On the fringes of this world, everything falls apart. Horrible monsters lurk, reality breaks down, and it's unclear what's real and what's not. The player needs to venture to the fringes to get something important. If the girl dies, the world is reset to the moment of creation. The girl is aware or the world resetting, but the flower is not. The deaths can be quite brutal and sudden. The first time should be a complete surprise – a shocking transition away from an ethereal and beautiful world.

The girl keeps her key items (like the pot) when she dies.

We follow the perspective of the girl.

Crucially, the flower has no more understanding than the girl. They both simply are.

## The spring

In order to build a proper relationship with the girl, the flower can't be out of the loop forever.

The spring's waters are special. They'll heighten the flower's awareness, allowing it to remember everything after the world resets.

We can have a good moment here where the girl just barely manages to water the flower in its pot with the spring water before dying. When she does and she's brought back to the park, the flower will say her name.

Before the girl dies for the first time, she should incidentally drink the spring water. Maybe it's bottled water from a vending machine or something. Also, the flower shouldn't have all of its petals at the beginning of the game.

The point being; who's to say how many times the girl has died before we take control.

## The fringes

Over the course of the game, the girl discovers something. In the fringes, there is a perennial seed. It would give the flower profound strength, enough to bring light to the world and protect all its inhabitants, at least for a time. However, the seed demands a terrible price; it must be planted in the heart of the flower's dearest friend.

Naturally, neither the flower nor the girl would know the seed's price until they reach it.

If the seed is never planted, the town, its inhabitants, and even the girl will soon wither into nothingness as the flower's petals disappear one-by-one.
