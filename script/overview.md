## Setting

This world is born of a single flower. It's a delicate little cornflower, only an annual. Beyond its own understanding, it wills into existence a little town, and in this town is a little girl.

The flower and the girl become friends, making conversation between them. At times, it shouldn't be clear whether this flower is actually talking or the girl is just playing children's games.
The girl gets a pot for the flower so they can take walks together.
Since cornflowers have vaguely medicinal properties, the flower's petals can serve to protect and heal the girl. Eventually, over the course of the game, the flower will look sad and have only a couple petals left.
The flower can’t be hurt by anything; it created this world. But the girl is vulnerable.

On the fringes of this world, everything falls apart. Horrible monsters lurk, reality breaks down, and it's unclear what's real and what's not. The player needs to venture to the fringes to get something important. If the girl dies, the world is reset to the moment of creation. The girl is aware or the world resetting, but the flower is not. The deaths can be quite brutal and sudden. The first time should be a complete surprise – a shocking transition away from an ethereal and beautiful world.

The girl keeps her key items (like the pot) when she dies.

We follow the perspective of the girl.

Crucially, the flower has no more understanding than the girl. They both simply are.
