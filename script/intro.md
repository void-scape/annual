## Introduction

At the moment of creation, she’s squatting by the flower, gazing at its delicate petals. The flower speaks:

"Hello!"

The girl, not quite sure what she heard, looks around as if someone might be there.

"Are you looking for something?"

She snaps back to the flower. "D-did you... I mean, are you a..."

"Is something wrong?"

The girl looks a little apprehensive. "Are you... talking?" She looks around again as if she’s getting pranked.

The flower responds "well, are you?"

She gets a little indignant. "But you’re a FLOWER!"

"Oh, I guess so..." Silence falls between them for a moment.

"Do you want to go on a walk," the girl asks. "I'd love to," the flower exclaims, "but I can't move."

Silence follows again, this time a little longer. The girl thinks for a moment. "I know! I'll come by tomorrow."

"Okay!"

"I'll bring all my friends," she says.

"I'll be waiting."

[The eventual goal for this scene is for the girl to find a pot to bring the flower along.]
